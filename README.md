# CS-445-Final-Project---Image-Processing-Based-Vehicle-Number-Plate-Detection-and-Speeding-Radar-
The scope of this project has been to implement an image processing-based traffic radar that detects vehicle number plates and subsequently measures the instantaneous vehicle speed. This application of computational photography/image processing was selected in order to develop an open source and cost-effective alternative to current speeding radar systems that can carry a price tag upwards of $6,500 per unit . As an open source technique, this will enable local authorities, municipalities, and facilities to implement their own low-cost and convenient traffic monitoring systems with off the shelf devices and equipment.
